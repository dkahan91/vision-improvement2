    <h2>Phase one - Phys dip</h2>
    <p>Be warned! this may take a lot quicker than you think! for some people it is a simple question of trying a few different games until you get the desired effect  - which is noticing that there is double vision where you definitely wouldn't have expected!</p>
<p>For some people though they can take quite a while to notice this ( and to believe it's possible ). Because it's difficult for some people I've decided to give you just one nice and easy thing (as this programme develops we will add more.)</p> <p>When you're ready to start Phase one game click below</p>
